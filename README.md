## Amazon Neptune Samples

Samples and documentation for using the Amazon Neptune graph database service

### Amazon Neptune Graphs and Jupyter Notebooks
Whether youâ€™re creating a new graph data model and queries, or exploring an existing graph dataset, it can be useful to have an interactive query environment that allows you to visualize the results. This [directory](neptune-sagemaker/README.md) has samples from two blog posts to show you how to achieve this by connecting an Amazon SageMaker notebook to an Amazon Neptune database. Using the notebook, you load data into the database, query it and visualize the results.

### Gremlin

#### Collaborative Filtering 
This is an [example](gremlin/collaborative-filtering/README.md) of using Gremlin and making recommendations using collaborative filtering. It includes examples of loading data and Gremlin traversals.

#### Visualize data in Amazon Neptune using VIS.js library
This [GitHub lab](gremlin/visjs-neptune) will take you through hands-on excercise of visualizing graph data in Amazon Neptune using VIS.js library. Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service available from AWS. With Amazon Neptune you can use open source and popular graph query languages such as Apache TinkerPop Gremlin for property graph databases or SPARQL for W3C RDF model graph databases.
